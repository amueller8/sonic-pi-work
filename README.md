# "Binary Search Tree"
## a song about Binary Search Tree traversal

This song details some important basics about binary search trees and the three traversal orders,
set in an upbeat major key along with buzzy synths and intermittent percussion. 
It is intended to get stuck in the listener's head, imparting BST wisdom in a fresh way!

The song starts with an intro that introduces a key musical motif (and sets the subject lyrically for the song).
We proceed into two verses, one of which introduces structural aspects of a BST and another which talks about preorder traversal.
We get the chorus, which reemphasizes the types of traversal before we cover the other two.

These are in-order and post order traversal.
We end with a chorus and then an outro that ends with an arpeggiated major chord-- enough to provide some finality but also,
ending on the way up, hopefully sends the listener off with a slight yearning for BSTs.

## Small Musical Analysis

Please see the brainstorming writeup for more in-depth insight into the musical process, but here we are:

### 2 Main Musical Ideas
<ul>
  <li>"binary search tree" chorus pattern</li>
  <li>dropped fifths in verses </li>
  
</ul>
I think dropping a fifth worked really well for communicating the idea of a “binary”-- I shifted between 2 different notes and created a sense of “halves”/binary. 
I hope the binary search tree (higher octave) riff is just catchy and fun! It makes me feel smiley because it is set higher above the music and using less of a buzzy synth like the backing chords). 

I use many "threads" to have "zawa" synth chords, "dpulse" synth melody, and percussion, sometimes all going at once and sometimes broken up.


## I want to listen without sung lyrics...

WEll, lucky for you I have uploaded a 'wav' file without the lyrics if you are ok not watching along with the video!


If you want to tinker with this on your own though...
Don't worry, you can run this code on Sonic Pi on your own!


Download the sonic.rb file from here. Save it locally on your computer.
Then, open Sonic Pi and run the following: 

```
run_file "path/to/the/file"
```
This prevents my song from overrunning the Sonic Pi character buffer.
On a Mac you can get the filepath by 'control-click'ing on a file and then holding down the option key to get the option to copy the filepath. Good
luck!
